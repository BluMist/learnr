  This is a demo of chained setup chunks with reticulate for illustrating two different languages sharing setup code.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(learnr)
library(gradethis)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
tutorial_options(exercise.checker = gradethis::grade_learnr)
d <- 3
```

# Addition

<!-- We'll start the setup chunk chain with a python chunk dataA: -->

```{python dataA}
a = 5
```

<!-- We can read a from the Python setup chunk! -->

```{r dataB, exercise.setup = "dataA"}
b <- py$a + d
``` 

<!-- However, we can now set the setup chunks for data1 as dataB and also inherit dataA. -->

```{r dataC, exercise.setup = "dataB"}
c <- b
```

Result of w should be 9.

```{r data1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "dataC"}
w = c + 1

```

Result of x should be 10.

```{r data2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "data1"}
x <- w + 1

```

Result of y should be 11.

```{r data3, exercise=as.logical(1), exercise.setup = "data2"}
y <- x + 1

```

Result of z should be 12.

```{r data4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "data3"}
z <- y + 1

```
